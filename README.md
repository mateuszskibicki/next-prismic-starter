# next-prismic-starter
Starter Next.js (newest version 8 and react/react-dom version 16.8 - HOOKS!!) with headless CMS Prismi, Jest testing and custom Express.js server/routing

#Why starter like this?

Server Side Rendering (Next.js) - connected with next-sass/node-sass -> see changes live

Jest testing with .babelrc so we can use node and react syntax

Preapred to deploy to heroku/now etc

Express.js with compression and express.json() (req.body)

Easy to connect with headless CMS (Prismic or any different on the market)

Easy to maintain file structure

We can connect it with mongodb/graphql/mysql or any different databse or microservice/REST API

next.config.js supports next-bundle-analyzer and CSS/SCSS so we can easiely check size of our bundle files

styles.scss -> main style file -> is imported in MainLayout so make it as a wrapper for each main page component (feel free to use different approach)
